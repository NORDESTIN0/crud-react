<h1>Welcome to my a firt React App CRUD</h1>

<p> Since this is my firt CRUD, so a Create:green_square:, Rename:yellow_square:, Update:blue_square: and Delete:red_square: will be functional</p>

> <h2> My Goal was to do something simple and functional so in this app we have:</h2>
## Example:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td> Name </td>
    <td> Email </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Gabriel Coelho </td>
    <td> gabriel@email.com:white_check_mark: </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The field Email is the only with validation, so if one user register a Email, it won´t be avaliable to another user.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td> Name </td>
    <td> Email </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Gabriel Coelho </td>
    <td> gabriel@email.com:x: </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
